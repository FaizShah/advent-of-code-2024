# Advent of Code 2024

This is my attempt at AoC 2024.

I work in many different languages so this will mainly be explorations in different languages for performance/semantics etc.

## Goals
Some possible goals:
- Use APL/J/Q
- Use SIMD
  - Compare Highway/Rust/ASM
- Use Elixir
- Use a LISP
  - Haskell?
